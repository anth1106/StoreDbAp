# StoreDbAp
practice with a connection to a database

# Preparation before running the program
you must create the database so the program can get the data to show it to the user
## On Windows
you would need to have xampp(could get it on requeriments link) and then you will have to open it and start apache and mysql

then you have to open the .sql from resources folder on the project, or from the .sql [releases](https://github.com/anth1106/StoreDbAp/releases/tag/v1.0.0)  and copy it and it will generate the database automatically
## On Linux 
you only have to open your database with a user that have permissions to create users and databases
and then you have to open the .sql from resources folder on the project, or from the .sql [releases](https://github.com/anth1106/StoreDbAp/releases/tag/v1.0.0)  and copy it and it will generate the database automatically
